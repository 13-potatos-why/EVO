First and Foremost I'd like to thank the following people for their contributions and help:

Pingopete: Thank you for being a major inspiration and motivator of the mod, along with providing the base code and 
textures for major parts of the mod, including Land Textures, EVE configs, and Scatterer Configs!

Avera9eJoe: Thanks for being a major help in teaching me about EVE, along with providing your beautiful sunflare from 
SPECTRA!

Jesús Rodríguez: Thank you for giving input, and your uranus riungs textures in support of EVO!

theyseN: Thank you for providing the backbone which this mod has been been built on, RSSVE.

Vabien: Thank you for making Kopernicus Expansion Continued-er, allowing me to add footprints to the planets of our solar 
system.

And lastly, thank you to my followers on twitch and in my discord, for encouraging me and supporting me in making these 
textures and atmospheres <3<3<3<3<3
